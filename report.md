# Code Review Distribution Plots

## Grader Normalized Average by Assignment

- The x axis corresponds to the code review grade week webpage at [http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/4500-f18/](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/4500-f18/)
- The y axis corresponds to the average grade given by the TA for the week, normalized from 0 to the maximum possible score for that week
- The weekly grades were often multimodal (see below), so error bars weren't included.
- Note that Kanika and Raghavendra grade 16-20 groups each week, and Alex grades ~8 each week
