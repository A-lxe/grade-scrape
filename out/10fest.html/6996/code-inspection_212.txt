1. No Observer directory. Observer implementation should be placed in Observer directory. (-5)
2. Strategy should be in Player directory. (-1)
3. Tournament manager is expected to know what to do with players that break
   the rules/diverge/misbehave specifically, it must say what to do with the
   current game (-5) and the games this player has won before the current one (-5)
4. Medthods in Observer have incomplete Signature definition - message is
   undefined in updateMisbehavior, playerMapCopy is undefined in updateRequest and
   updateModification. (-2)
