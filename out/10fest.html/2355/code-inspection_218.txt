You don't specify how the tournament manager or the run_tournament method
connects with the players. It only takes a number as input and not a list
of players or anything like that, and you don't have any method that takes
players as input.

Your tournament manager design says "If a player breaks or violates a rule, it 
loses that match but remains in the tournament." This is okay for assignment 10, 
but for assignment 11 players that break should be thrown out of the tournament.

The observer should have a method to observe events where the Referee has 
detected misbehavior by one of the players. This method should be separate
from observations that the game has ended and the other player has won.

Your Unit tests test against players that go into infinite loops, and those
tests are good for testing observations that the other player "p2" wins. 
However, there should also be observations that "p1" or "p3" misbehaved,
separate from the game ending and the other player winning.

Good that you used named constants like BOARD_SIZE and MAX_HEIGHT.
