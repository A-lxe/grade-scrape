The player implementation should be in Santorini/Player, not Santorini/Common.

The result of a tournament could be a tie between multiple users.

I can't find tests for the `ReceiveTurn` or `ReceiveBoard` observer methods. 

The observer should be able to observe events where the Referee has detected
misbehavior by one of the players.

Good that you use named constants like MaxBuildingHeight and NormalBoardSize.
