In the TournamentManager design, you say "Broken players need not be handled
specially, the referee will ensure they lose all of their matches." This is
okay for assignment 10, but for assignment 11 broken players should be thrown
out of the tournament.

The TournamentResults data definition doesn't have an "interpretation" of
what the String keys or those two Ints mean. You also don't specify which 
functions a client should use to find the winners from the TournamentResults.

Good job specifying something about breaking Ties! Even if the final design
ends up not being exactly what you specified, it's good to be thinking of these 
sorts of things.

I can't find any Unit tests for Observer, StdoutObserver, JSObserver, or any of
their associated methods or functions.

Good that you use named constants like boardSize, and even a finite type for 
Floors.
