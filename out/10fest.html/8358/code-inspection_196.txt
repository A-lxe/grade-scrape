1. observer implementation should be placed into the Observer directory. (-5)
2. Numeric constant - 5 is used in ViewModelBoard at line 60,61. (-2)
3. The reportResults is not private as mentioned in the comments. (-1)
4. Checking when player is broken -  etc. is vague, it is the description of the function that you are writing. (-2)
 

Suggestions:
Do you really want to print in your functions of observer?
