It's not obvious/easy for the caller of run_tournament to tell the winners
of the tournament, even though it's possible. You could fix this either by
changing the return type or adding a helper function.

I can't find any Unit tests for the Observer or any of its methods.

The observer should be able to observe events where the Referee has detected
misbehavior by one of the players.

Good that you use named constants like BOARD_HEIGHT and BOARD_WIDTH.
