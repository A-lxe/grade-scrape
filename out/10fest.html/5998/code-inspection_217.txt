The observer implementation should be in a new Observer directory, not in Common.

Your docstring for the AbstractTournamentManager says that it "returns the list 
of players that got the most total wins". This belongs in the docstring for 
run_tournament.

Your test for test_played_turn doesn't seem to be testing the output. It says
expected ["Board:\n"], but it doesn't actually expect the specific board that you 
passed in.

Good that you use named constants for things like BOARD_SIZE and MAX_HEIGHT.
