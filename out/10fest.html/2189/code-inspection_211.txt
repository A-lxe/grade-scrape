1. There are two Rule checkers - one in common one in Admin- it should be in Common only. (-1)
2. Signature of notify_end_game is not defined. Purpose statements incorrect. (-2)

Suggestions:
Think about how you will calculate the result if you are nullifying the games
in which broken player has played, and the player has broken at the last game.
And what about the opponent.
