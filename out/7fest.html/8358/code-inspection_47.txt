Your Testme.sh file runs the integration tests (n-{in,out}.json, for the whole
system), but it doesn't run any Unit tests, tests for single methods or single
components.

I can't find any Unit tests anywhere, and your README and Testme files don't
guide me to them.

The purpose statements in your RuleChecker look good.

None of your tests check that it's illegal to build on a square with a worker
or too-tall building. All of the negative tests seem to be only be checking
out-of-bounds.
