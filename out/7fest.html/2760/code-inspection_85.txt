The RuleChecker should be able to validate moves and builds *without* modifying
the gameState to actually attempt the moves, builds, or turns.

I can't find any Unit tests for the RuleChecker by itself, and your README and
Testme files don't guide me to them. Your integration tests (for the whole
xrules system) in rules-tests/n-{in,out}.json look good, but those are not a
substitute for Unit tests on individual RuleChecker methods.
