1. Readme should be present in every folder and updated to reflect changes with every submisssion to aid navigate the code.
2. Does not check for adjacency in checking the validity of move.
3. Documentation not consistent, not found on RuleChecker class and check build, check move methods.
4. No test case in json tests to check worker and/or building is placed on the same spot ("staying put").
