Your xrules startReadFromClient method seems to be delegating to the Player
(this.dummyPlayer) rather than a RuleChecker. The player "happens" to delegate
to AbstractReferee static methods to check moves and builds. However, the
`xrules` test harness, and other components later on, should not be trusting
the player with this; it should be using the RuleChecker (or AbstractReferee
static methods) directly.

You have two unit tests for the `canMove` method of the rule checker in
TestReferee, but I can't find any unit tests the `canBuild` method (the tests
in TestXRules don't directly test the rule checker `canMove` or `canBuild`
methods). There should be more unit tests in TestReferee, for both `canMove`
and `canBuild`.
