You only have a README for the Design sub-directory of Santorini. You should
have a README for Assignment 7 (in the `7/` directory) as well. This README
isn't updated for Assignment 7 either.

You don't have any unit tests for the RuleChecker or any of its methods. You
have the rules-tests/*-{in,out}.json files as _integration_ tests for the
system as a whole, but you're missing unit tests that would test specific
methods and components by themselves.

Your README for the assignment should also describe where the unit tests are,
the TESTME file should show how to easily run the unit tests.

For your first integration test, 1-{in,out}.json, it looks like that sequence
of move and build should be illegal (because you'd be building on top of the
worker "a2"), but your expected-output says "yes" anyway.

For your third integration test, 3-{in,out}.json, it looks like this should be
legal, but your expected output says "no". It's possible you're interpreting
what "SOUTH" means differently.
