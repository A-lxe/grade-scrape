Your TESTME file runs your integration tests, the tests for the whole system in
n-{in,out}.json, but it doesn't run any Unit tests, the tests for single
methods and single components by themselves.

I can't find any Unit tests anywhere, and your README and Testme files don't
guide me to them.

The n-out.json files should contain valid JSON strings, such as `"yes"` and
`"no"`. You currently have versions without the quotes (`yes` and `no`), which
are not valid JSON strings. You can use the `serde_json::Value::String`
constructor to create a valid JSON string.
