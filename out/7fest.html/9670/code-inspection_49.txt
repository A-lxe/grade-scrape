1. Readme should be present in each folder and updated with every assignment to reflect cahnges and help navigate reading code.
2. No test case in json tests to check worker and/or building is placed on the same spot ("staying put")

Suggestions : While writing docs on classes, please include @param as well - that is the correct way of javadoc representations. Also some tools have javadoc generation, you might want to check it out to understand what i mean by the correct way.
