1. Purpose Statements should be more descriptive. Example - Verify the given movement of the Worker is not a very descriptive purpose statement as it does not give any more information than the name itself.
2. Readme should be in all folders and help navigate the reading of code.
3. No case in json tests to check for worker and/or building is placed on the same spot ("staying put").
