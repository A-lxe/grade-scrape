Warning: 
As per your readme,the following is the distribution of files:
Admin -- Holds code related to the "administrator" of the game
Common -- All code that both administrative components and player components need to access 
However, you have placed your RuleChecker in Admin, implying Player does not
have access to it. If the players don’t know the rules and can’t inspect them,
they can’t produce a move/component. Please investigate carefully the placement
of files.
