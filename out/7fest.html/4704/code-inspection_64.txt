Your TESTME script runs your integration tests, the tests for the whole system
in n-{in,out}.json, but it doesn't run any Unit tests, the tests for single
methods and single components by themselves.

The unit tests you do have look good; the TESTME should run them. This could be
as simple as having the TESTME run the Santorini/Test/allTests script that you
already have (possibly using pushd/popd since it's dependent on relative
paths).

Your purpose statements in the RuleChecker look good.
