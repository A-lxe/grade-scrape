You should have a README file in the 6/ directory, not just in the Santorini directory, and it should describe both how the source code is organized and how to run the test harness. You should also have a TESTME file that describes how to run the tests, including unit tests.

You seem to be doing a lot of JSON parsing manually within xboard, for example removing `[]` brackets and splitting on `,` commas yourself, rather than delegating to a JSON library. This kind of thing makes your code very hard to read and will make it hard to maintain. You should find a JSON library that allows you to read and write JSON values, as a JSON-tree-like data structure, not as strings.

After this I should not see things like `string.split(",")`, or `string.contains("\"")`, or `string.split("\\[")`, or `scanner.useDelimiter(",")`, or `string.replace("[", "")` anywhere in your code. And definitely no manual JSON parsing or String parsing within the logic of your code.

You should not be representing so many things as Strings to be parsed later.

You don't have unit tests or examples for any board methods except one that's just manual JSON parsing. All but that one of your JUnit tests are empty.
