The xtest file should be called xboard (you likely named your file before the assignment was updated to specify xboard).

Consider turning some of the things in TestBorad.py into actual unit tests of those methods.

You should have a board method for finding the neighboring squares on the board. The closest thing you have is `getPosition` in the `xtest.py`. Something similar to that should be part of the board for finding neighboring squares, and it should have unit tests associated with it.
