Your README file doesn't specify key things like how the code-base is organized and where to start reading it. You don't specify how to run the tests either in a "TESTME" file or the README.

You should have either unit tests or worked examples for individual board methods. You do have one "integration" test for the whole board system in board-tests/{1-in.json,1-out.json}, but a unit test should show one component or one method by itself.
