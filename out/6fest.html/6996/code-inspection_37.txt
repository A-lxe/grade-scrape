You don't have a TESTME file that describes how to run the tests, and your README doesn't specify this either.

You should have either unit tests or worked examples for individual board methods. You do have 4 "integration" tests for the whole board system in board-tests/{*-in.json,*-out.json}, but a unit test should show one component or one method by itself.
