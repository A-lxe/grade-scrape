The Referee should be in the Admin directory, not the Common directory.

The Observer should be observing *events*, not just the game state and winner.
The type you have for the `tellGameState` method actually does allow observing 
Turn events (both Place and MoveBuild). However, the name and purpose statement 
don't say this. Where you say: "used by the referee to tell the observer about a 
new game state", you should also say that the referee tells the observer every 
time there's a Turn event.

You should also have a method for observing when the Referee detects "erroneous 
behavior" by a player.

The Referee should attempt to detect when players might go into an infinite loop.
You might find the `timeout` function from `System.Timeout` useful for that.

I can't find any Unit Tests for the Referee or any of its functions. The only 
test-suite is `Test/Unit/`, which contains tests for the board, the rule checker, 
the strategies, and the player, but not the Referee.

The purpose statement for `takePlayerTurn` should specify that it should return 
PlaceTurns (the left of the either) in the start-up phase, and MoveBuildTurns
(the right of the either) in the main phase of the game.
