It would be cleaner if the Referee, Strategy, and Player interfaces dealt with some 
type for "the actions that a player can take on a turn", which is a combination of a 
move and a build, instead of dealing with Moves and Builds separately.

This also applies to the events that the Observer deals with. A turn event could be
a *combination* of a move and a build, not a _one-of_ that might be either a move or a 
build.

The Observer should be able to observe events where the Referee has detected
"erroneous behavior" by a player.

You should have a player method for a player taking a turn. If you have a type
for "the actions that a player can take on a turn", this method should return
that type. This would be a replacement for the currently separate `get_move`
and `get_build` methods.

I can't find any unit tests for Player or LocalStrategyPlayer.
