You are absolutely allowed to create interfaces for existing classes, or even 
change classes in other ways. You are also allowed to add Enums or other 
datatypes that might make the codebase cleaner, and allowed to refactor 
method names so that they are more readable. Each change should be 
incremental, but you _can_ change the given code base.

The observers (spectators) should be observing *events*, not just the board 
state. This includes worker-placement events, player-turn-action events, and 
events for when the Referee detects "erroneous behavior" by a player. This should 
feel like each observer method acting as an event callback.

Your RefereeTests should not be commented out. It's better to have failing
unit tests than to have commented-out tests.

Your PlayerAiImplTests should not be commented out either.
