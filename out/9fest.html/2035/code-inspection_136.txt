Player implementation not placed in player folder

The observer missing methods to observe following events
   a placement action
   a turn action, and
   any erroneous behavior by a player (see Implementation Task)

No Unit tests found for referee

Following methods missing for player:
  place the first two initial workers
  take a turn (accept board, return action request)
