It would be cleaner if the Referee, Strategy, and Player interfaces dealt with some 
type for "the actions that a player can take on a turn", which is a combination of a 
move and a build, instead of dealing with Moves and Builds separately.

Where is the Observer design? The README doesn't say, and it's not in the
Design folder.

The Referee should have a method for running an entire game, and a method for 
running an entire series of games.

You should have a player method for a player taking a turn. If you have a type
for "the actions that a player can take on a turn", this method should return
that type. This would be a replacement for the currently separate `get_move`
and `get_build` methods.
