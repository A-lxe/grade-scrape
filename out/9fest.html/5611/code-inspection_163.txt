1. Function to observe any erroneous behavior by a player is missing. (-4)
2. Function description is ambiguous for acceptCurrentPlayerInfo. Is it for
   placement or only setup? (-1)
3. The variable names in signature of getNextAction should be descriptive or
   appropriate. (-1)

Bonus:
1.for checking a player that raises an exception during the placement step. (+2)
