The observer should be able to observe Turn events, or all the actions 
that a player can make on a turn. It's unclear whether `record_move` does 
that, and your docstring / purpose-statement doesn't specify. Does it 
record only "move" actions, or does it record "turn" actions that might 
be a combination of a move and a build?

The observer should also be able to observe when the Referee detects
"erroneous behavior" by a player.

I can't find any Unit tests for the Player or any of its methods.

(+1) To test the Referee, you tried to simulate a player taking forever
by giving it a `LookAheadNStrategy(30)`. You commented that

A better way would be to define a Mock player class which intentionally
goes into an infinite loop, just for the purposes of testing the Referee.
