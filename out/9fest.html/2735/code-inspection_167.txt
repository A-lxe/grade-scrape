The observers should be observing *events*, not just the board state, winner,
or turn-number. The `get_last_played_turn` method is _almost_ correct. However,
an observer doesn't have to "request" to view the board or see the last action.
The Referee calls its methods when events happen, with the *input data* that's 
relevant for those events. You can think of each of these methods as a kind of 
callback. The Referee will call the observer back when something happens. The 
method for observing Turn actions, for example, should take a Turn action as an 
input.

You should also have methods for observing worker-placement actions and
observing "erroneous behavior" by a player.

I can't find any unit tests for the Player or its methods.

(+2) Bonus points for testing your Referee against an "infinite loop" player!
