The observers should be observing *actions*, not just the board state and
players. There should be methods for observing Turn actions, Worker 
placement actions, and also for observing "erroneous behavior" by a 
player. The method for observing Turn actions, for example, should take a 
Turn action as an argument. An observer doesn't have to "request" to view 
the board or see the last action. The Referee calls its methods when 
events happen, with the input data that's relevant for those events.
You can think of each of these methods as a kind of callback. The Referee will
call the observer back when something happens.

It's somewhat confusing that the play-a-game functionality of the Referee and
the play-a-series-of-games functionality are merged into the same method
`run_game`. It would be better if those were two separate methods.
