Details like which IDE you use is not important for these Design / plan documents.

Your plan should clearly outline the two phases:
 1. A prototype with minimal functionality, and 
 2. A full-fledged system that supports running automated tournaments.
You briefly mentioned these two phases at the very end; make it clearer and show the plans for the prototype first before you describe the details of how you'll build full system.
