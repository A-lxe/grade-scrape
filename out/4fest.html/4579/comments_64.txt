None of the entities in your plan act as a "referee" to determine whether player's moves are valid (the players can't be trusted to validate themselves).

Your plan doesn't specify how tournaments will be run between automated players.

You specify a class for players, there should also be an interface through which different AI players would make decisions about which moves they want to play.

Your plan should include at least two phases:
 1. A prototype with minimal functionality, and 
 2. A full-fledged system that supports running automated tournaments between AI players.
