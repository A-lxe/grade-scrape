Your plan describes how Games are played and managed by the Server with a GameBoard object, but it does not show how it would support tournaments between AI players.

Your plan should include at least two phases:
 1. A prototype with minimal functionality, and 
 2. A full-fledged system that supports running automated tournaments.
