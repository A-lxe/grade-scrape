There is no purpose statement for the main method or the file as a whole. The
purpose statements that do exist are vague.

There are also discrepancies between the spec you sent to Codemanistan vs. what
you assumed and used "from" it. Your Client code assumes the Codemanistan code
takes names of spreadsheets as inputs, while your spec specifies a Spreadsheet
class meaning spreadsheet objects would be inputs. Your Client code also
assumes the Codemanistan code takes JFs (Json-Formulas) as inputs, while your
spec specifies a Formula class.
