The purpose statements on your methods mostly look good, except that the
purpose statement for the Main class / the client as a whole doesn't mention
spreadsheets.

There seems to be some slight discrepancies between your Server spec and how
you use things "from" it. In `convertJF` where you construct formulas, your
client code just calls `new Constant()` or `new Addition()`, with no arguments.
Your spec doesn't specify exactly what arguments the constructors take, but it
doesn't specify setter-methods either, so most people would assume that the
`Constant` constructor for example takes a single value and stores it, and that
the `Addition` constructor takes the two formulas and stores them. 

You should also call `convertJF` recursively on the sub-trees in the
Multiplication and Addition cases, since those classes store Formulas and not
JF-trees.

Your `doAt` method uses the `sheet.get` method to get the formula for a cell,
which is a correct use of your Server spec. However, you never call the
`evaluate` method on that formula, and instead treat it as if it were already
the "value".
