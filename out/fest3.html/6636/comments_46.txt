The purpose statements / docstrings on your methods mostly look good, but
you're missing a purpose statement for the client as a whole. This could be a
comment at the top of the file.

Where you use the methods from the server spec you sent to Codemanistan, you
assume that you can pass in JF trees (Json-Formula trees), which does not match
what you specified formulas to be in your spec (strings). Strings were a bad
representation choice in the spec.
