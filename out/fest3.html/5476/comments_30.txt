The purpose statements / docstrings on your methods mostly look good, but
you're missing a purpose statement for the client as a whole. This could be a
comment at the top of the file or a docstring on the main SpreadClient class.

The purpose / docstring for `parse_json` leaves out an important part of what
it does. Yes, it parses JSON input, but after parsing it also dispatches on
which type of command the JSON represents.

The `evaluate` method is called when the user puts in an "at request". The
client should print the value in that cell, but it shouldn't necessarily print
"Value of 3, 4 in my-sheet is: 5"; only "5". Also, it doesn't print "false" to
indicate a circularity.
