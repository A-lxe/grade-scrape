You don't have purpose statements or docstrings for any of your functions, or
for the main file as a whole. You should give a simple (one-line) description
of what each function does, it's "job" to do.

You don't use any functions / methods from your server spec. In addition, the
server spec you sent to Codemanistan deals with spreadsheet objects (with
either dictionaries-of-dictionaries or 2D lists) and formula objects, while the
commands you're dealing with in your client only provide spreadsheet names and
JF trees.
