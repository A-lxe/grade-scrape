The purpose statements on your functions mostly look good, but you're missing a
purpose statement for the client as a whole. This could be a comment at the top
of the file. Also the words "Helper function for" in a purpose statement are
unnecessary.

The main event handler is pretty long (it takes up more than a full page of
text, you can't see the whole thing without scrolling), and does multiple
"jobs," so it could be split into multiple smaller functions.

The parseJF function is necessary to convert JF-trees into the strings that you
specified in the spec you sent to Codemanistan. However, it doesn't convert
combinations of addition and multiplication properly.

For example `parseJF([3, "+", [4, "*", 5]])` and `parseJF([[3, "+", 4], "*",
5])` both produce the string "3+4+5". The server will not be able to
distinguish between many formulas which should be different. Strings were not
the best representation choice in your spec.
