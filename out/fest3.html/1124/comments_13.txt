There are a lot of places where your "purpose statements" say one thing (with a
TODO), and your function does something else. Even then most of them are vague
and don't specify anything other than the "would-be" return type of the method.
You're also missing a purpose statement for the client as a whole.

You don't use any classes or methods from your Server spec. For example, the
server spec you sent to Codemanistan deals with Formula objects and
SpreadsheetValue objects, while your client code only has JF-trees. It never
converts those JF trees into Formula objects. It also doesn't deal with the
SpreadsheetValue objects that would be returned from those formulas.
