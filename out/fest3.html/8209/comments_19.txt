The purpose statements on your methods and on the class as a whole mostly look
good.

The purpose statement for `checkValidLine` leaves out an important part of what
it does. It doesn't just check that it's of type array, it also determines what
type of command the JSON represents, and checks that it's a valid command
according to that.

The `generateSpreadSheets` method is a bit long, and does multiple "jobs." It
might benefit from being split into multiple smaller methods, similar to how
you split some of the functionality of `checkValidLine` into
`isProperSheetRequest`, `isProperSetRequest`, and `isProperAtRequest`.

Be careful about the difference between "x and y" vs "row and column", because
the order is switched. X corresponds to column-number and y corresponds to
row-number. When you call addCell in the "set" case or getValueAt in the "at"
case, x is in `node.get(2)` but you call it row, and y is in `node.get(3)` but
you call it col.
