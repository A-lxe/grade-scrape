1. Expecting interface to specify a run a game method. (-3)
2. Expecting  the referee interface to specify how the referee gets to know the players. (-3)
3. No test cases found to check the implementation of diagnol placement, farthest strategy and canStaylive. (-10). (you got some marks for the function itself)

Suggestions:
1. Please consider the name of files in the folder - Santorini/Player as test, when they are not test classes.
