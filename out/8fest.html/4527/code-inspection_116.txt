Your Referee class is overcrowded. It should not have functions like tryMoveWorker, actionCheck, tryPlaceWorker etc  which should be a part of rulechecker and your referee should use that instead. (-2)
The referee does not specify a "run a game" method (-3)
No unit tests found (-15)

Suggestion:
Think about what all components need to be common folder.
