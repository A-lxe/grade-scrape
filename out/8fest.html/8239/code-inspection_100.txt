The Referee needs some way to "run a game", possibly with another method.

The docstring "Defines a Referee interface" is not a good docstring for the
Referee interface. What is the purpose of the Referee? The referee is supposed
to start a game and supervise the game until the end. It should be closer to a
controller than a validator.

I can't find any unit tests for the Strategy or any of its methods. You have
the strategy-tests/*-{in,out}.json files as _integration_ tests for the system
as a whole, but you're missing unit tests that would test specific methods and
components by themselves, like the `decide_place`, `decide_move`, and
`decide_build` methods of Strategy.
