The purpose statements in your IStrategy interface look good. 

The interface should not have separate methods for `placeWorkerInDiagonal` and
`placeWorkerFarFromOthers`. Instead, the interface should have one method for
`placeWorker`, and there should be two *implementations* of the strategy that
implement that one method differently.

The unit tests in SantoriniTests should be put in a sub-directory of Santorini,
possibly in Santorini/Tests or Santorini/UnitTests.

You have unit tests for calculating all possible turns, determining
survivability, determining winnability, and placing workers in the start-up
phase, but you're missing unit tests for the choice-of-action functionality
produced by the `nextTurn` method. If you're worried about "randomness" or
"arbitrariness" in choosing from multiple valid options, you can still test
properties of the ITurn produced.
