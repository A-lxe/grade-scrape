It was harder than normal to find the Referee interface specification. The
README says that it exists, but doesn't direct someone where to look to find
it. I eventually found it in Santorini/Common/GamePieces/src/Referee.java, but
this was not obvious and the README doesn't help with navigating this.

Your Referee purpose statements should specify how the Referee gets to know the
players. You specify that it will "have access" to them, but not how. How do
the players get passed in?

The IStrategy doesn't have a method for placing workers in the start-up phase
of the game. The nextMove method isn't very specific on what it returns (what a
"move" is). Strings aren't very good for specifying structured data like this,
and raw JSON isn't very good either unless you specify exactly what the
structure of it is and what everything within it means. 

You should have a proper structured data definition for what the "next move"
could be. Or more accurately, what the whole "next turn" should be, for the
choice-of-action functionality. A single turn involves a combination of a move
and a build.

You should not be representing so many things as Strings to be parsed later.

You have unit tests for the `placeWorker` method, but not for the `nextMove`
method, or choice-of-action method.

There doesn't seem to be a strategy method for determining whether a player can
stay alive or not from a given board, or any unit tests for it.
