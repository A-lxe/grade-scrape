1. Your interface is overcorwded. Functions like moveWorker, builLevel etc
   should not be a part of the referee as they are already implemented by the
   RuleChecker. Referee should be able to use rulechecker to implement this. (-2)
2. Interface expects the terms in signatures to be defined. ex -
   placeWorker(playerName, x, y) the terms are not defined. (-3)
3. No unit tests found. (-15)

Suggestions:
Please consider abstraction and reusability.
