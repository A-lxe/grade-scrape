The SantoriniReferee needs some way to "run a game," possibly with another
method. You say in the purpose statement for the file: "intended to start a
thread that runs the game", but I don't see any method declaration for that.
Your existing methods don't mention that in their purpose statements.

Your purpose statements for the SantoriniStrategy interface look good.

You don't have any unit tests for the "choice of action" methods,
recommendWorkerPlacement and recommendWorkerAction. If you're worried about
"randomness" or "arbitrariness" in choosing from multiple valid options, you
can still test properties of the actions produced.

Your unit tests for canStayAlive should test with depths greater than 3.
