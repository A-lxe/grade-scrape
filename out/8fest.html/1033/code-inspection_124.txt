A turn should use a combination of a move and a build. A turn cannot be just a
move or just a build. Your data definition for a TurnSpecification instead only
allows it to be only one or the other by itself, not the combination. This
means that TurnStategy.strategize method can't produce a full turn.

In the main phase of the game (after start-up), the Strategy should deal with
"turns" or "actions" that are a combination of a move and a build.

I can't find any unit tests for the Strategy or any of its methods. You have
the strategy-tests/*-{in,out}.json files as _integration_ tests for the system
as a whole, but you're missing unit tests that would test specific methods and
components by themselves, like IStrategy.place, IStrategy.move,
IStrategy.build, or TurnStrategy.strategize.
